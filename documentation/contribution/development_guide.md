# Development Guide

## Development

1. Self-managed Kubernetes

   * Requirements

     Here is the list of minimum requirements for self-managed Kubernetes.

     ```text
     Kubernetes - v1.19
     Docker - 18.03 or Containerd - 1.3.7
     Linux Kernel - v4.15
     LSM - AppArmor
     ```

     KubeArmor is designed for Kubernetes, which means that Kubernetes should be ready in your environment. If Kubernetes is not prepared yet, please refer to [Kubernetes installation guide](k8s_installation_guide.md). KubeArmor also requires Docker or Containerd since it internally uses their APIs. If you have other container platforms \(e.g., Podman\), please make an issue in this repository. While we are going to adopt other container platforms in KubeArmor, we may be able to adjust the priorities of our planned tasks on demand. KubeArmor requires LSMs to operate properly; thus, please make sure that your environment supports LSMs \(at least, AppArmor\).

     Note that KubeArmor does not work on MiniKube because MiniKube does not support AppArmor. In addition, KubeArmor does not work with Docker Desktops on Windows and MacOS because KubeArmor integrates with Linux-kernel native primitives such as LSMs.

     * \(Optional\) MicroK8s Setup

       In order to install MicroK8s, please run the following command.

       ```text
       $ cd contributions/bare-metal/microk8s
       (microk8s) $ ./install_microk8s.sh
       ```

   * Environmetal Setup

     In order to install all dependencies, please run the following command.

     ```text
     $ cd contributions/self-managed-k8s
     (self-managed-k8s) $ ./setup.sh
     ```

     [setup.sh](https://github.com/accuknox/KubeArmor/blob/master/contributions/bare-metal/setup.sh) will automatically install BCC \(latest\), Go \(v1.15.2\), and Protobuf \(3.14.0\).

     Now, you are ready to develop any code for KubeArmor. Enjoy your journey with KubeArmor.

2. Vagrant Environment

   * Requirements

     Here is the list of requirements for a Vagrant environment

     ```text
     Vagrant - v2.2.9
     VirtualBox - v6.0
     ```

     If you do not have Vagrant and VirtualBox in your environment, you can easily install them by running the following command.

     ```text
     cd contributions/vagrant
     (vagrant) $ ./setup.sh
     ```

     * VM Setup using Vagrant

       If you do not have ssh keys in '~/.ssh' yet, you need to run the following command in advance.

       ```text
       (vagrant) $ ssh-keygen -> [Enter] -> [Enter] -> [Enter]
       ```

       Now, it is time to create a VM for development. You can directly use the vagrant command to create a VM.

       ```text
       (vagrant) $ vagrant up
       ```

       If you want to remove the created VM, please run the following command.

       ```text
       (vagrant) $ vagrant destroy
       ```

       You are ready to develop the code for KubeArmor. Enjoy your journey with KubeArmor.

       ```text
       (vagrant) $ vagrant ssh
       ```
